# StorageObserver
This script allows you to set up observers that display notifications when the resource level in a storage is lower or higher than requested. Observers can be added to any building and they can monitor almost all resource types.
## How to use
To set up an observer, run ''Add storage observer'' script from the scripts menu and follow the instructions at the top of the screen. Use Q/E keys to change the values in the menus and the ''Accept'' script (from the Command Scripts mod) to go to the next step of the setup.

If everything went well, you should see a popup confirming that the observer has been successfully added.

## Limitations
- Because this mod utilizes the objectives UI to display interactive menus, it can't be used in the campaign mode.
- Vehicles and containers (including nuclear fuel and UF6) are unsupported.
- Garbage stands are unsupported.
