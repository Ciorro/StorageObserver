This script allows you to set up observers that display notifications when the resource level in a storage is lower or higher than requested. Observers can be added to any building and they can monitor almost all resource types.

[h2]How to use[/h2]
To set up an observer, run ''Add storage observer'' script from the scripts menu and follow the instructions at the top of the screen. Use Q/E keys to change the values in the menus and the ''Accept'' script (from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3590208830]Command Scripts[/url] mod) to go to the next step of the setup.

If everything went well, you should see a popup confirming that the observer has been successfully added.

[h2]Limitations[/h2]
[list][*]Because this mod utilizes the objectives UI to display interactive menus, it can't be used in the campaign mode.
[*]Vehicles and containers (including nuclear fuel and UF6) are unsupported.
[*]Garbage stands are unsupported.
